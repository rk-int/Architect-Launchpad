## Run the Exam Interactively in Claude Code

The `cert-exam-skill.md` file is a Claude Code skill. To use it:

**1. Copy the skill to your Claude Code skills directory:**

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp cert-exam-skill.md .claude/skills/cert-exam.md
```

**2. Run it from Claude Code:**

```
/cert-exam          # 20 questions (default)
/cert-exam 10       # quick 10-question session
/cert-exam 40       # deeper practice
/cert-exam 77       # full exam simulation
```

**3. Copy the exam file so the skill can find it:**

```bash
mkdir -p "Claude Certification"
cp "Claude Certification Exam.md" "Claude Certification/Claude Certification Exam.md"
```

The skill will:
- Ask your preferred question count and domain focus
- Present each question using Claude's interactive UI (options A/B/C/D)
- Give immediate feedback or a summary at the end (your choice)
- Calculate a scaled score and pass/fail result
